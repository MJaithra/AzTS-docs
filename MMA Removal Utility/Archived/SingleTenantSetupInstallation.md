____________________________________________________________________

## **Method A:**

> _**Note:** Please validate the prerequisites [here](./Prerequisites.md) and then proceed with the below steps_

This setup is divided into five steps: 

1. [Load setup script](#step-1-of-5-load-setup-script)
2. [Installing required Az modules](#step-2-of-5-installing-required-az-modules)
3. [Setup remediation user-assigned managed identity](#step-3-of-5-setup-remediation-user-assigned-managed-identity)
4. [Setup installation](#step-4-of-5-setup-installation)
5. [Configure target scopes](#step-5-of-5-configure-target-scopes)

Let's start!


### **Step 1 of 5. Load setup script**
 
 1. Point the current path to the folder containing the extracted deployment package and load the setup script for AzTS MMA Removal Utility <br/>


  ``` PowerShell
  CD "<LocalExtractedFolderPath>\AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDeploymentFiles\DeploymentFiles"

### **Step 2 of 5. Installing required Az modules**

Az modules contain cmdlet to deploy Azure resources. These cmdlets are used to create AzTS MMA Removal Utility resources with the help of templates. Install the required Az PowerShell Modules using the below commands. 
For more details of Az Modules refer [link](https: //docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

Please make sure Step 1 has been completed successfully before proceeding with this step. <br/>
``` PowerShell
# Install required modules
Set-Prerequisites
```

<br/>

### **Step 3 of 5. Setup remediation user-assigned managed identity**  
The AzTS MMA Removal Utility solution works in 2 phases: 
1. Discovers VMs, VMSS, Azure Arc Servers and their Extensions to identify the resources from which MMA Agent will be removed for which setup requires ***Reader*** access on the scope being configured.
2. Removes MMA Extensions from the eligible Azure resources for which setup requires ***Virtual Machine Contributor*** and ***Azure Arc ScVmm VM Contributor*** access on the scopes being configured. Scopes Configured can be a Tenant/ManagementGroup(s)/Subscription(s) or both ManagementGroup(s) and Subscription(s).

For executing the above phases, setup requires a [User-Assigned Managed Identity (MI)](https: //docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) (identity part of the setup) which has 'Reader and Virtual Machine Contributor' access on target scopes configured.

> _Note:_
> 1. _For creation of remediation user-assigned MI setup (preferably in a separate new RG), user running this script should have **Owner** access on the subscription in which MI is being created. If the MI is being created in an existing RG, user should have **Contributor** access on the RG._
> 
> 2. _For granting remediation user-assigned MI with above mentioned roles on the target scopes, user running this script should have **User Access Administrator (UAA) or Owner** on the configured scopes. For example, the setup is being configured for a subscription 'X', user should be having UAA role assignment on the subscription 'X' to be able to grant the remediation user-assigned MI with the required permissions._
>

Before setting up the remediation user-assigned MI, please log in to Azure Account using the following PowerShell command.

``` PowerShell

# Connect to AzAccount
# Note: Tenant Id *must* be specified when connecting to AzAccount

$TenantId = "<TenantId>"
Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $TenantId
```

Setup the remediation user-assigned MI using Set-AzTSMMARemovalUtilitySolutionRemediationIdentity command. When this command is run successfully, the remediation user-assigned MI is created and the created identity is granted with 'Reader', 'Virtual Machine Contributor' and 'Azure Arc ScVmm VM Contributor' permissions on target scopes.

``` PowerShell
# -----------------------------------------------------------------#
# Create remediation user-assigned MI
# -----------------------------------------------------------------#

$Identity = Set-AzTSMMARemovalUtilitySolutionRemediationIdentity ` 
         -SubscriptionId <MIHostingSubId> `
         -ResourceGroupName <MIHostingRGName> `
         -UserAssignedIdentityName <MIName> `
         -Location <Location> `
         -TargetSubscriptionIds @("<SubId1>","<SubId2>","<SubId3>") `
         -TargetManagementGroupNames @("<MGName1>","<MGName2>","<MGName3>") `
        [-TenantScope]

# -----------------------------------------------------------------#
# Identity resource id will be accessed in the execution of next steps 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------#
$Identity.Id
```

**Sample output snapshot:**

### **Step 4 of 5. Setup installation**  
Setup installation can be done using Install-AzTSMMARemovalUtilitySolution. This command will install the MMA Removal Utility which helps to discover and remove MMA agent installed on Virtual Machines.

> _Note:_
> _For creation of the setup in a new RG, user running this script should have **Owner** access on the subscription in which setup is being created. If the setup is being installed in an existing RG, user should have **Owner** access on the RG._
> 

Install-AzTSMMARemovalUtilitySolution PowerShell command will perform the following operations: 

- Prompts and collects onboarding details for usage telemetry collection based on user preference.
- Creates the RG if it does not exist.
- Creates or updates the resources with MIs assigned.
- Creates or updates the monitoring dashboard.

``` PowerShell
# -----------------------------------------------------------------#

### **Step 5 of 5. Configure target scopes**
Target scopes can be configured using Set-AzTSMMARemovalUtilitySolutionScopes. This command will configure the target scopes on which MMA Removal Utility setup will run.

``` PowerShell
# -----------------------------------------------------------------#
# Configure target scopes
# -----------------------------------------------------------------#

$ConfiguredTargetScopes = Set-AzTSMMARemovalUtilitySolutionScopes ` 
         -SubscriptionId <HostingSubId> `
         -ResourceGroupName <HostingRGName> `
         -TargetSubscriptionIds @("<SubId1>","<SubId2>","<SubId3>") `
         [-TenantScope]
```

**Sample output snapshot:**

### **Step 2 of 2. Consolidated installation**  
Consolidated installation can be done using Install-AzTSMMARemovalUtilitySolutionConsolidated.

The AzTS MMA Removal Utility solution works in 2 phases: 
1. Discovers VMs, VMSS and Azure Arc Servers and there Extensions to identify the services from which MMA Agent will be removed for which setup requires ***Reader*** access on the scope being configured.
2. Removes MMA Extensions from the eligible VMs, VMSS and Azure Arc Servers for which setup requires ***Virtual Machine Contributor*** and ***Azure Arc ScVmm VM Contributor*** access on the scopes being configured. Scopes Configured can be a Tenant/ManagementGroup(s)/Subscription(s) or both ManagementGroup(s) and Subscription(s).

For executing the above phases, setup requires a [User-Assigned Managed Identity (MI)](https: //docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) (identity part of the setup) which has 'Reader', Virtual Machine Contributor' and 'Azure Arc ScVmm VM Contributor' access on target scopes configured.

> _Note:_
> 1. _For creation of remediation user-assigned MI and the setup (preferably in separate new RGs), user running this script should have **Owner** access on the subscription in which MI is being created. If the setup is being done in an existing RG, user should have **Owner** access on the RG._
> 
> 2. _For granting remediation user-assigned MI with above mentioned roles on the target scopes, user running this script should have **User Access Administrator (UAA) or Owner** on the configured scopes. For example, the setup is being configured for a subscription 'x', user should be having UAA role assignment on the subscription 'x' to be able to grant the remediated user-assigned MI with the required permissions._
